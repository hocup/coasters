          <p>Oh No! This game doesn't have any rules!</p>

              Paper prototyping is a fun and efficient way to try out a game design. This set of coasters is there to help. Think of ways to turn them into a game and then use the form below to publish your rules!

          <p>
              All fields other than your email will be public. The email is gathered on the off chance I add the ability to edit your published rule sets. Consider using <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">markdown</a> in the main rules area for better formatting.

              Some ideas I haven't thought through: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Group up with someone else with a set of coasters, for more play area and more tokens</li>
            <li>Trace the edges of the coasters onto paper, for an even bigger play area</li>
            <li>Use the punchable tokens instead of dice by flipping the numbered ones upside down and picking one at random</li> 
            <li>Use the coasters to hold the drinks involved in your idea of what Brett Kavanaugh's original drinking game "The Devils Triangle" might be like</li>
            <li>Draw on the play area coasters! Flip the tokens over and draw on those too!</li>
            <li>Flick the tokens across the table for a neat kinetic game</li>
        </ul>
